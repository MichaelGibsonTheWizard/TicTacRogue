# TicTacRogue

This is a python3 game following this tutorial: http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/1

This will not complile unless you install libtcod. This is system specific, see here:http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod,_part_1

At the point of tutorial completion, this will begin to transform into a more unique game, and the README will be changed at that time to reflect it.
